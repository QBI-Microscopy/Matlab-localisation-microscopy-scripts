To use this collection add all folders to the path (in MATLAB)

The repo is organised as follows:

1. scripts

pair_correlation_script.m - a script which calculates pair correlation functions (either auto- or 
cross-correlation) on tabulated XY super resolved coordinates. It creates a reconstructed image on
which the user defines a region of interest and then calculates the correlation function and fits the
data to a model selected by the user (calls worker_functions/run_correlation_and_fit.m and
utilities/get_autocorr.m or utilities/get_crosscorr.m).

ripley_function_omero_script.m - this script is used to connect to OMERO and downloads XY coordinates
extracted from regions of interest and annotated to a reconstructed super resolved image. This requires
the OMERO MATLAB toolbox to function (https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.1.0/). When the
download completes the ripley function is calculated (calls worker_functions/run_ripley_calculation.m and
utilities/ripleykfunction.m)

ripley_function_rois_script.m - a script which calculates the ripley function on XY molecular coordinates
in ROIs which have been defined in a reconstructed super resolution image in OMERO. First draw ROIs using
in Insight and run the Get_Coordinates_In_ROIs.py script. Download the resultant data to a local folder
and use this folder as an input to this script to calculate the ripley function in each region (calls
worker_functions/run_ripley_calculation.m and utilities/ripleykfunction.m

ripley_function_script.m - a script to calculate ripley's functions on tabulated XY molecular coordinates.
The script recontructs an image from the input data allowing a user to define a region of interest. After
the calculation finishes the user is prompted to mark the peak position on the ripley function data and
subsequently the calculation runs again at this single distance scale producing interpolated images of the
value of the ripley L function at XY coordinate (calls worker_functions/run_ripley_calculation.m and
utilities/ripleykfunction.m)

2. simulations
simulations of pair correlation and ripley function data

3. utilities
utility functions used by scripts and worker_functions

4. worker_functions
called from scripts (scripts are purely for providing inputs to the worker_functions)
